                <p style= "Playfair Display", serif;">     My name is Diana Juan and I am an incoming junior in my local high school. Out of all my family members, I get along with my little brother
                    very well.  On my free time I do the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>draw/sketch</li>
                        <li>volunteer at a hospital</li>
                        <li>think of a positive future</li>
                        <li>read fanfiction</li>
                        <li>play videogames</li>

                        I am not quite the social type thus I tend to avoid social gatherings, conversations, ect. 
                         </p>

                         <h2>How would I Describe Myself?</h2>
                        <p style="Playfair Display", serif;">  I am open-minded. I love to learn different languages and I am open to new things. I am very self-reserved! I do not really like to interact with people because
                         literally all my life I had my nose stuck in a book thus making it hard for me to socialize. I am anti-social! Like I stated above I just dislike interacting with
                         strangers but I get over it. Interacting with people is part of life.</p>
